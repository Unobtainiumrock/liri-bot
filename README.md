# LIRI Bot

This is a node.js application that experiments with using a few node modules for interacting with some API's.
These modules include the twitter package and node-spotify-api package, and request.

## Requirements and Setup
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with the included npm.
* IMPORTANT make sure you have at least Node version 7.6 for [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) to run properly.

**Create accounts at the following services to receive API keys**
* [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com/)
* [Spotify API](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

## Terminal: Getting Started How to
**Run the following commands in your terminal**
```
git clone https://github.com/Unobtainiumrock/liri-bot.git 

cd liri-bot

npm install
```
**Create two files for storing API keys and setting up environment variables**
* create a file named `keys.js` with the following content
```javascript
console.log('this is loaded');

exports.twitter = {
  consumer_key: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY,
  consumer_secret: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET,
  access_token_key: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY,
  access_token_secret: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
};

exports.spotify = {
  id: process.env.SPOTIFY_ID,
  secret: process.env.SPOTIFY_SECRET
};
```

* create a file named `.env` with the following content and add your own API keys and secrets
```
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

# Twitter API keys

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-twitter-consumer-key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-twitter-consumer-secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=your-access-token-key
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-twitter-access-token-secret
```

## Example Commands
Each terminal command can be called without providing your own Tweet handler, movie, or song name -They will default to provided search values. Try these commands out with/without providing your own values. Make sure to be in the app root level where liri.js resides

```
node liri.js do-what-it-says

node liri.js my-tweets

node liri.js spotify-this-song

node liri.js movie-this
```
